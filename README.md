Bootstrap Features I Used:
Navbar: I added a navigation bar that adjusts to different screen sizes, so it's easy to use on both computers and phones.
Cards: I used cards to display information in a clean and attractive way.
Grid System: I used a 12-column grid to make the layout responsive and organized.
Buttons: I added buttons that allow users to scroll or jump to different sections of the page.
Collapse: I used collapsible elements like dropdowns to organize content in a neat way.
Forms: I created easy-to-use forms with built-in validation to make it simple for users to submit information.
Modals: I added pop-up windows to show extra information without leaving the page.
Font Awesome: I used icons to make the page look nicer and easier to understand.
Utility Classes: I used utility classes to adjust spacing, alignment, and text style, keeping the design consistent and polished.

JavaScript Features I Added:
Scroll-to-Top Button: I added a button that shows up when you scroll down and takes you back to the top when clicked.

Sticky Navbar: I made the navigation bar stay at the top of the screen when you scroll down.
Back-to-Section Buttons: I added buttons that help you quickly jump to different sections of the page.
Intersection Observer for Animations: I used an effect that makes sections fade in when they appear on the screen.
